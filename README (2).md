# What social and economic factors are most important in predicting happiness?

The World Happiness Report is a publication that uses survey data to show how people across the world rate their happiness. An entry in the report is a country's average response to life evaluation questions for a given year between 2005 to 2020. Several social and economic variables are measured in these questions such as the "Freedom To Make Life Choices" and "GDP Per Capita". I was wondering which of these factors are the most important in predicting a country's happiness? I also want to find out which type of model performs the best at predicting a country's happiness.

To answer these questions, I will test the Machine Learning Algorithms Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosting, and Bagging on the World Happiness Dataset to find the the model that predicts the data best and identify the most statistically significant variables.
